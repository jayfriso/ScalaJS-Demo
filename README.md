This is a simple Demo demonstrating scalaJS with the play framework.
This was written for a report done for the University of British Columbia.

I have used these projects as a base/example:
https://github.com/vmunier/play-with-scalajs-example : Used this as a base app, in order to have the project, and sbt config set up.
https://github.com/kostrse/scalajs-knockout-sample : Used (and modified) the knockout js-facade provided here.
